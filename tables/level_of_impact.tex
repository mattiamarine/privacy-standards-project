        PII that \textit{requires a legitimate interest} for access

        \hline
        PII whose unauthorized disclosure can \textit{affect the reputation} of the PII principal

        \hline
        PII whose unauthorized disclosure, modification, loss or destruction can 
        \textit{affect the existence or the health, freedom and life} of the PII principal 
        (e.g. information about commitment to an institution, a sentence, personnel reviews, 
        health data, unserviceable debts, or if the PII principal is at risk of becoming a victim 
        in a criminal case)
